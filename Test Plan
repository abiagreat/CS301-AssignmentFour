Assignment 4 Project Plan

Assignment 4 will include Student.cpp, Student.h, main.cpp, Grades.out, and Grades.dat files.
We will test our test driver for all the possible outputs.
We expect that based on the command instructions, the output would be displayed accordingly. 

The logic will be the following:

Test Cases: 11 
We tried to test every possible output. 

class names: CompareStudentsByName, CompareStudentsByID, Student

functions: for, while, if-else, switch (case statements), inputFile, outputFile
